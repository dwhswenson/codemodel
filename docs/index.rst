CodeModel
=========

Coming soon: documentation for CodeModel. CodeModel is an advanced set of
metaprogramming tools that serves as the backend for several projects
currently in development. Once those projects become public, the full
documentation of CodeModel (which contains many references to those
projects) will be unveiled!

The source code for CodeModel is already public, so you're welcome to use it
in your own projects. However, we'll hold off on telling you how we're using
it until our own projects work.
